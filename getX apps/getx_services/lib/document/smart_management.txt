// Smart Management
//GetX provides SmartManagement that lets us configure how dependencies
// behave in terms of memory management.
// GetMaterialApp {
// smartManagement: SmartManagement.full // or .keepFactory or .onlyBuilder
// }
// Full Mode
// Everything gets disposed as soon as the route is removed from navigation stack,
// unless declared permanent.

// SmartManagement.keepFactory
//==
// Just like SmartManagement.full, it will remove it's dependencies when I
// 'it's not being used anymore. However, it will keep their factory,
// which means it will recreate the dependency if you need that instance again.

// SmartManagement.onlyBuilders
//====
// With this option, only controllers started in init: or loaded into a Binding
// with Get.lazyPut () will be disposed.
//
// If you use Get.put() or Get.putAsync() or any other approach, I
9/1 SmartManagement will not have permissions to exclude this dependency.
