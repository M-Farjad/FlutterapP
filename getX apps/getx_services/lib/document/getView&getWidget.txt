GetView:
    if we have a single controller as a adependency then we can use GetVIew instead
    of StatelessWidget avoid wiritng Get.find()

GetWidget:
    similar but gives the same instance with Get.find() everytime. USeful when used
    with Get.create() but when used with GetView doesn't increment
